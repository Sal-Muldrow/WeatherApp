# WeatherApp

## Inspiration 
I wanted to make an app the gets data from an api.

## What it does
This app gets the current temperature in a zip code and displays it
The data comes from:
https://openweathermap.org/current

## How I built it
I built it using React and React Native.


## What I learned
More about async promises and ES6 syntax.
## What's next for AppTano
More data, better UI, bug fixes
## Here's what it looks like
